Welcome to BASH Database Management System.

Below is a short description of how to set up and use the DBMS.

1) Open 2 terminals and execute ./server.sh and ./client.sh $id.  This will start the server and a named client, as well as setting up server and client$id pipes.

2) The system alows clients to create databases and tables, and also insert and select data from the tables.  Text is entered into the client standard input.  Examples are given below:

create_database DB 			(creates a database called DB)

create_table DB Table 1,2,3		(creates a table in DB with the columns 1,2,3)

insert DB Table a,b,c			(inserts "a,b,c" as a new row into Table)

select DB Table				(selects all data from Table)

select DB Table 1,3			(selects the 1st and 3rd columns from Table)

select DB Table 1,3 1 a			(selects the 1st and 3rd column from the Table where column 1 = "a")

shutdown				(shutsdown the server)

exit					(exits the client)

It is not permitted to create a database that already exists.
You can not CREATE a table in a Database that does not exist.
You can not INSERT data into a Table in a Database if the Table or Database do not exist.
SELECT may not return any results depending on your search criteria.
